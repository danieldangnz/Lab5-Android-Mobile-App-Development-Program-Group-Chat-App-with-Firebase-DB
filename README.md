Lab 5: Create a “Group Chat App” using Firebase

Objectives
Mobile applications need a back-end server in order to perform tasks such as authenticating users and synchronizing user data across multiple devices. 
Creating such a server, however, requires a skill set that most independent app developers lack. 
Fortunately, there are several back-end as a service platforms, often called BaaS, you can use today. Google's Firebase is one such platform.

Firebase offers essential services such as analytics, crash reporting, user authentication, and cloud messaging at no cost. 
Its freemium services include a real-time NoSQL database, file hosting, and static website hosting.

In this tutorial, students learn how to use Firebase UI to create a group chat app (a real-time social application) you can share with your friends.
It's going to be a very simple app with just one chat room, which is open to all users.

As you might have guessed, the app will depend on Firebase Auth to manage user registration and sign in. 
It will also use Firebase's real-time database to store the group chat messages.
You also learn how to add user authentication, analytics, and remote real-time cloud data storage to your Android app using Firebase.
